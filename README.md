## Bugs/Work Needed

1. I plan to add more error checking if data fails to fetch for whatever reason.

2. While not necessarily a bug, I recognize that I could do better with the file organization. I can and I WILL do better next time.

## thoughts...
I made this web application for fun. I wish i was able to do more regarding the data displayed but i was held back by the limited data i was allowed to use from the APIs.
